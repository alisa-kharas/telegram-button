        The project shows the alternative more suitable way of adaptating packaging of the most needed products for blind people in order to simplify their living and to make their lives more independent. It's a series of tactile flock stickers that can be applied to any already existing brand without changing it. And the logo surface consists out of circles different sizes depending on the type of the product. So it means that by touch a blind person will be able to recognise the brand of food and its type such as milk fatness for example. The black colour of packaging and stickers were chosen in order to show the design from blind person point of view-no image, just touch.
